 # About myself
 
  * Hi, Iâ€™m Zachary Muzzleman. I am a senior computer science major with a concentration in AI/Robotics at the University of Delaware. I love coding and problem solving to find better solutions.
 
 # My plans
 
  * I am currently looking for an intership or entry level job of some sort to expand my knowledge on the computer science field. I want to learn, grow, and always try to become better within my field. I would love to work in a field that is involved with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Minining. However, I have worked some time with websites; including front, backend development, and I quite enjoy it. So I wouldn't mind working in that field as well.
 
 # Programming Languages I Have Worked With
  * C Language
  * CSS
  * HTML
  * Java
  * Javascript/Typescript
  * Lisp
  * Python
  * SQL Oracle
 
 ## I Have Also Worked With a Couple of Frameworks
