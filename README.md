 # About myself
 
  * Hi, Iâ€™m Zachary Muzzleman. I am a senior computer science major with a concentration in AI/Robotics at the University of Delaware. I love coding and problem solving to find better solutions.
 
 # My plans
 
  * I am currently looking for an intership or entry level job of some sort to expand my knowledge on the computer science field. I want to learn, grow, and always try to become better within my field
    
  # Things I've learned
  
  * I have worked with many coding languages throughout my school years. To name a few I have worked with: Java, Javascript, C Langauge, Python, SQL Oracle, and Lisp. I've enjoyed my time with all of them, but I gravitate more towards Java, but I always try to learn new things with each lanaguage and as well use different langauges for different projects.
