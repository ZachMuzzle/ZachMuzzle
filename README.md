 # About Myself
 
  * Hi, Iâ€™m Zachary Muzzleman. I am a senior computer science major with a concentration in AI/Robotics at the University of Delaware. I love to work with technology, programming, and one of the things I love about it is that there is always something new to learn and improve on.
 
 # My plans
 
  * I am currently looking for an internship or entry level job of some sort to expand my knowledge on the computer science field so I can continune to learn and grow in this field. I would love to work in a field that is involved with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Mining. However, I have worked some time with websites; including front, backend development, and I quite enjoy it. So I wouldn't mind working in that field as well.
