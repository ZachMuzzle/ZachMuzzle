 # About myself
 
  * Hi, Iâ€™m Zachary Muzzleman. I am a junior computer science major with a concentration in AI/Robotics at the University of Delaware. I love coding and problem 
    solving to find better solutions.
 
 # My plans
 
  * I am currently looking for an intership of some sort to expand my knowledge on the computer science field. I want to learn, grow and always try to become better within my field
    
  # Things I've learned
  
  * I have worked with many coding languages throughout my school years. To name a few I have worked with: Java, Javascript, C Langauge, Python, and SQL Oracle.
  I've enjoyed my time with all of them, but I gravitate more towards java, but I also enjoy python and in the process of trying to improve with SQL.
